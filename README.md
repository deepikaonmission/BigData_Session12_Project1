# BigData_Session12_Project1

For Project 1 i.e. "USA Crime Analysis", following files and screenshots are provided:

NOTE 1: Pig Programs (not mapreduce) are developed for the required tasks and inside each .pig file, explanatin for each line of code is given
NOTE 2: All .pig files are run in local mode

Pre-requisites to run Pig Program ------------->>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
1. Start historyserver
Refer Screenshot 1.JPG
2. Start Hadoop Daemons
Refer Screenshot 2.JPG

TASK1 ----->>>>>>>
Write a Pig program to calculate the number of cases investigated under each FBI code
1. Refer task1.pig file for code [run .pig file using "pig -x local task1.pig" command]
In my case I executed the .pig file in terminal with "pig -x local /home/acadgild/Documents/Project1/task1.pig" command
2. Refer Task1Output.JPG for output

TASK2 ----->>>>>>>
Write a Pig program to calculate the number of cases investigated under FBI code 32
1. Refer task2.pig file for code [run .pig file using "pig -x local task2.pig" command]
In my case I executed the .pig file in terminal with "pig -x local /home/acadgild/Documents/Project1/task2.pig" command
2. Refer Task2Output.JPG for output

TASK3 ----->>>>>>>
Write a MapReduce/Pig program to calculate the number of arrests in theft district wise
1. Refer task3.pig file for code [run .pig file using "pig -x local task3.pig" command]
In my case I executed the .pig file in terminal with "pig -x local /home/acadgild/Documents/Project1/task3.pig" command
2. Refer Task3Output.JPG for output

TASK4 ----->>>>>>>
Write a MapReduce/Pig program to calculate the number of arrests done between October 2014 and October 2015
1. Refer task4.pig file for code [run .pig file using "pig -x local task4.pig" command]
In my case I executed the .pig file in terminal with "pig -x local /home/acadgild/Documents/Project1/task4.pig" command
2. Refer Task4Output.JPG for output
